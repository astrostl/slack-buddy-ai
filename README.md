- **‚è∞ Flexible Time Filtering**: Support for various time formats (24h, 7d, 1w, etc.)
- **üîê Secure Configuration**: Environment-based token management with git-safe storage
- **üõ°Ô∏è Enterprise Security**: Automated vulnerability scanning, dependency checks, and security monitoring
- **üí° Intelligent Error Handling**: Clear, actionable error messages for missing permissions and configuration issues
- **‚úÖ Fully Tested**: Successfully tested with real Slack workspaces with 95%+ test coverage

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.19 or higher
- Slack Bot Token with appropriate permissions

### Build from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/slack-buddy-ai.git
cd slack-buddy-ai
go build -o slack-buddy
```

## Setup

### 1. Create a Slack App
1. Go to [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Create a new app for your workspace
3. Add the following OAuth scopes:
   - `channels:read` - To list channels
   - `chat:write` - To post announcements
4. Install the app to your workspace and copy the Bot User OAuth Token

### 2. Configure Token
Create a `.env` file in the project directory:
```bash
SLACK_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token-here
```

Or set the environment variable directly:
```bash
export SLACK_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token-here
```

**Note**: If you get permission errors, the tool will tell you exactly which OAuth scopes to add in your Slack app settings.

## Usage

### Basic Channel Detection
```bash
# Load environment variables
source .env

# Detect new channels from the last 24 hours
./slack-buddy channels detect

# Detect from last week
./slack-buddy channels detect --since=7d
```

### With Announcements
```bash
# Detect and announce to #general
./slack-buddy channels detect --since=24h --announce-to=#general

# Detect from last 3 days and announce to #announcements
./slack-buddy channels detect --since=3d --announce-to=#announcements
```

### Using Token Flag
```bash
# Use token directly without .env file
./slack-buddy channels detect --token=xoxb-your-token --since=1w
```

### Time Format Examples
- `24h` - Last 24 hours
- `7d` - Last 7 days
- `1w` - Last week
- `48h` - Last 48 hours
- `30m` - Last 30 minutes

## Commands

### `channels detect`
Detect new channels created within a specified time period.

**Flags:**
- `--since` - Time period to look back (default: "24h")
- `--announce-to` - Channel to announce new channels to
- `--token` - Slack bot token (can also use SLACK_TOKEN env var)

**Examples:**
```bash
./slack-buddy channels detect --since=7d --announce-to=#general
```

## Security

### Built-in Security Features
- **Token Validation**: All Slack tokens are validated and sanitized
- **Rate Limiting**: Exponential backoff prevents API abuse
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are validated
- **No Token Logging**: Tokens never appear in logs or error messages

### Automated Security Scanning
- **Daily Vulnerability Scans**: Automated dependency and security checks via GitHub Actions
- **Static Analysis**: gosec security scanner catches common Go security issues
- **Dependency Monitoring**: Dependabot automatically updates vulnerable dependencies
- **License Compliance**: Automated license scanning to prevent GPL contamination

### Best Practices
- Never commit your `.env` file or Slack tokens
- Use bot tokens (`xoxb-`) with minimal required OAuth scopes
- Store tokens in environment variables, never in code
- Run `make security-full` before deploying to production

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reporting and detailed security information.

## Roadmap
