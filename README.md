- **üîê Secure Configuration**: Environment-based token management with git-safe storage
- **üõ°Ô∏è Security Features**: Basic security scanning and dependency monitoring (community-maintained)
- **üí° Intelligent Error Handling**: Clear, actionable error messages for missing permissions and configuration issues
- **‚úÖ Well Tested**: Successfully tested with real Slack workspaces with good test coverage

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.24.4
- Slack Bot Token with appropriate permissions

### Install via Go
```bash
go install github.com/astrostl/slack-buddy-ai@latest
```

### Build from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/astrostl/slack-buddy-ai.git
cd slack-buddy-ai
go build -o slack-buddy
```

## Setup

### 1. Create a Slack App
1. Go to [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Create a new app for your workspace
3. Add the following OAuth scopes:
   - `channels:read` - To list public channels
   - `groups:read` - To list private channels
   - `chat:write` - To post announcements
   - `channels:history` - To prevent duplicate announcements (idempotency)
4. Install the app to your workspace and copy the Bot User OAuth Token

### 2. Configure Token
Create a `.env` file in the project directory:
```bash
SLACK_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token-here
```

Or set the environment variable directly:
```bash
export SLACK_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token-here
```

**Note**: If you get permission errors, the tool will tell you exactly which OAuth scopes to add in your Slack app settings. The `groups:read` scope is only needed if you want to detect private channels.

## Usage

### Health Check
```bash
# Basic health check
./slack-buddy health

# Detailed health check with verbose output
./slack-buddy health --verbose
```

### Basic Channel Detection
```bash
# Load environment variables
source .env

# Detect new channels from the last day
./slack-buddy channels detect

# Detect from last week
./slack-buddy channels detect --since=7
```

### With Announcements
```bash
# Detect and announce to #general
./slack-buddy channels detect --since=1 --announce-to=#general

# Detect from last 3 days and announce to #announcements
./slack-buddy channels detect --since=3 --announce-to=#announcements
```

### Dry Run Mode
```bash
# Preview what would be announced without posting
./slack-buddy channels detect --since=1 --announce-to=#general --dry-run

# Test announcement formatting and channel detection safely
./slack-buddy channels detect --since=7 --announce-to=#announcements --dry-run
```

### Using Token Flag
```bash
# Use token directly without .env file
./slack-buddy channels detect --token=xoxb-your-token --since=7
```

### Time Format Examples
- `1` - Last 1 day (24 hours)
- `7` - Last 7 days (1 week)
- `2` - Last 2 days (48 hours)
- `0.5` - Last 12 hours (half day)
- `30` - Last 30 days (1 month)

## Commands

### `health`
Check Slack connectivity and validate configuration.

**Purpose:**
- Verify token validity and format
- Test Slack API connectivity
- Check required OAuth scopes and permissions
- Validate bot user information
- Test basic API functionality

**Flags:**
- `-v, --verbose` - Show detailed health check information

**Examples:**
```bash
./slack-buddy health
./slack-buddy health --verbose
```

### `channels detect`
Detect new channels created within a specified time period.

**Flags:**
- `--since` - Number of days to look back (default: "1")
- `--announce-to` - Channel to announce new channels to
- `--dry-run` - Preview what would be announced without posting messages
- `--token` - Slack bot token (can also use SLACK_TOKEN env var)

**Examples:**
```bash
./slack-buddy channels detect --since=7 --announce-to=#general
./slack-buddy channels detect --since=1 --announce-to=#general --dry-run
```

## Security

### Built-in Security Features
- **Token Validation**: All Slack tokens are validated and sanitized
- **Rate Limiting**: Exponential backoff prevents API abuse
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are validated
- **No Token Logging**: Tokens never appear in logs or error messages

### Security Scanning (Best Effort)
- **Static Analysis**: gosec security scanner integration available
- **License Compliance**: Basic license scanning to avoid GPL dependencies

> **Note**: Security scanning tools are available but require manual setup. No guarantees provided.

### Best Practices
- Never commit your `.env` file or Slack tokens
- Use bot tokens (`xoxb-`) with minimal required OAuth scopes
- Store tokens in environment variables, never in code
- Test `make security` locally (may require tool installation)

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reporting and detailed security information.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Channel cleanup detection (inactive channels)
