# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

This is an open source project with **no official support or warranty**. While we appreciate security research, please note that this project is maintained on a best-effort basis.

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **DO NOT** create a public issue with vulnerability details
2. **DO NOT** disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed

Instead:

1. Create a **GitHub issue** with minimal details (e.g., "Security concern - please contact me")
2. We will reach out directly to discuss the details privately
3. Include your preferred contact method in the issue if different from your GitHub account

### What to Expect

- **No SLA or guaranteed response time** - This is a volunteer-maintained project
- **Best effort response** - We will do our best to address legitimate security concerns
- **No bounty program** - This project does not offer financial rewards for vulnerability reports

### Scope

This policy applies to vulnerabilities in:
- The slack-butler CLI tool itself
- Dependencies and build processes
- Security misconfigurations in the codebase

### Disclaimer

This project is provided "as is" without any warranties. Users are responsible for their own security assessments before deploying this tool in production environments.
